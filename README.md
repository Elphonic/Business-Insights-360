## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing consumer electronics company, operates across multiple countries. Despite its rapid expansion, the company relied heavily on Excel for analytics, which made data consumption inefficient and slowed down decision-making. This lack of actionable insights even led to a major financial loss in Latin America.

To address these challenges, I built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard as part of my **Business Insights 360** project, transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

## Solution Approach

### Key Dashboards Delivered:

**Finance View** – Profit & Loss statement to assess financial performance across markets, products, and customers.\
**Sales View** – Identifying top/bottom customers using key metrics with a matrix-based analysis.\
**Marketing View** – Similar to the sales view but focused on product performance.\
**Supply Chain View** – Forecast accuracy and reliability insights for better operational efficiency.\
**Executive View** – A high-level dashboard with key insights for decision-makers.
